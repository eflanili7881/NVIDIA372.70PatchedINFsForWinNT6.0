# Patched NVIDIA 372.70 INF Files for Pascal-based GPU for use in Windows Vista
This repository contains patched INF files for Windows Vista for NVIDIA's Desktop 372.70 driver.

## Credits
- NVIDIA for providing INF files.
- Me for patching INF files.
- Microsoft Corporation for providing various .NET Framework versions.
- archive.org for providing Wayback Machine service.

## What's that patch contains?
This patch contains support for probably all GPU's from v391.35 as I took all driver ID's from this version and I injected into v372.70 and it's the last version for 32-bit architecture. But I only tested this patch with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti as it's only non-native GPU for Windows Vista on my hand. This patch doesn't enable GPU acceleration on DirectX applications, although you can play 4K videos on MPC-HC. And this patch can only be installed on Windows NT 6.0-based OS' (Windows Vista/Server 2008) as I removed every entries for other OS'. I tested 64-bit one but I didn't tested the 32-bit one.

## Screenshots
Here's some screenshots that I took on 2019:

## How to install this patch?
So, here's how you install this patch. But before you install this driver, I strongly suggest you to update to SP2.
- You need to install these programs and updates (Not necassary but they're improving compatibility.):
  - .NET Framework (Vanilla driver requires .NET Framework) (Select one of them, but my suggestion is download the latest version for Windows Vista)
    - .NET Framework 4.6.1 (last version /wo Windows Update support before 4.6.2 was only signed with SHA-2)
